# SwiftUI's LazyVStack vs. VStack
## Which for better

Difficulty: **Beginner** | Easy | Normal | Challenging<br/>
This article has been developed using Xcode 15.0, and Swift 5.9

## Terminology:
`VStack`: A staple SwiftUI container view that arranges its child views in a vertical stack. `VStack` is eager in its rendering approach, meaning it creates all of its child views as soon as the `VStack` is rendered. This can make for simpler code and more predictable layouts, but can lead to performance issues with large numbers of child views.
`LazyVStack`: A container view that arranges its child views in a vertical line. Unlike `VStack`, `LazyVStack` does not create its views all at once. Instead, it creates them lazily, only as they are needed for display. This can lead to performance improvements, especially with large numbers of views.

# The Basic Syntax
I've whacked both a VStack and a LazyVStack into some simple project code.
```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            VStack(alignment: .center, spacing: 10) {
                Text("Top View")
                Divider()
                Text("Bottom View")
            }
            LazyVStack(alignment: .center, spacing: 20) {
                ForEach(0..<10) { index in
                    Text("Row \(index)")
                }
            }
        }
        .padding()
    }
}

#Preview {
    ContentView()
}
```

As you can see the top example is using a `VStack` to layout two views vertically

```swift
    VStack(alignment: .center, spacing: 10) {
        Text("Top View")
        Divider()
        Text("Bottom View")
    }
```

The lazy version shows that `LazyVStack` has similar syntax but we need to remember that this has lazy rendering behavior. Although not shown here, a `LazyVStack` is typically used within a  ScrollView since its lazy nature becomes advantageous with scrollable content as all of the content is not usually available on the screen.:

```swift
LazyVStack(alignment: .center, spacing: 20) {
    ForEach(0..<10) { index in
        Text("Row \(index)")
    }
}
```

Both `VStack` and `LazyVStack` provide essential functionality for vertical layouts in SwiftUI applications. The choice between them depends on the specific needs of your layout and the performance characteristics of your content.

Which means I should start to explain just that.

# Memory Usage and Initial Load Time
## Rendering

**VStack**
Immediate Rendering: All child views within a `VStack` are instantiated and rendered as soon as the `VStack` appears on the screen. This immediate rendering approach can lead to increased memory usage, particularly with large numbers of child views.
Suitable for Fewer Views: For smaller collections of views or static content, the immediate rendering behaviour of `VStack` does not typically pose a problem and can provide a simple and effective solution.

**LazyVStack**
Lazy Rendering: `LazyVStack`, on the other hand, creates its child views only when they are needed for display. This lazy loading approach can significantly reduce memory usage and initial load time when dealing with large collections of views.
Optimal for Large Collections: In scenarios such as displaying a long list of items, `LazyVStack` can greatly improve performance by only rendering views that are currently visible to the user, especially within a `ScrollView`.

## Scrolling Performance
When incorporated into scrollable content, the differences in rendering behaviour between `VStack` and `LazyVStack` become even more apparent:

**VStack**
Preloaded Content: Since `VStack` loads all its child views at once, users can scroll through the content without any delay caused by loading. However, this can lead to longer initial loading times and increased memory usage, which can affect the overall smoothness of the scrolling experience in large lists.

**LazyVStack**
On-Demand Rendering: `LazyVStack` loads views as they become visible during scrolling. This approach can lead to smoother scrolling performance in long lists, as the memory footprint is reduced and views are not rendered until necessary.
Potential for Delayed Rendering: While `LazyVStack` can improve scrolling performance, there may be instances where the user scrolls faster than the views can be rendered. This can lead to temporary blank spaces appearing, although they typically fill in quickly as the views load.

# Conclusion

The choice between `VStack` and `LazyVStack` should be based on the specific needs of your SwiftUI application. `VStack` is well-suited for static content or smaller collections of views, where the immediate loading of all views is not a concern. In contrast, `LazyVStack` is ideal for dynamic content or large collections of views, where lazy loading can significantly enhance performance and user experience.
